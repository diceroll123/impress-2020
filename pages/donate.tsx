/**
 * getStaticProps loads the donation info and organizes it into a convenient
 * structure for the page props.
 *
 * This happens at build time! This data basically hasn't changed since 2017,
 * so we'd rather have the performance benefits and reliability of just
 * building it up-front than making this an SSR thing. (It also makes it harder
 * for someone to add a surprise prank message years later when we're not
 * paying attention, by editing the outfit titleâ€”it would still probably make
 * it onto the site eventually, but not until the next build, which should be
 * discouraging. But nobody's ever tried to prank this page before, so, shrug!)
 *
 * I also just went with a direct DB query, to avoid putting any of this in our
 * GraphQL schema when it's really super-duper *just* for this page and *just*
 * going to be requested in super-duper *one* way.
