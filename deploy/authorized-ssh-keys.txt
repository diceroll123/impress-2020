# These are the SSH public keys that allow a user to log in and setup or deploy.
#
# It's dangerous to add a new key to this file! When you run
# `yarn deploy-setup`, it will copy these keys to the deploy server, which will
# allow the owner of these keys to log into the deploy server in the future.
#
# But the keys themselves aren't necessarily sensitive data, except for the name
# at the end, which might tell a reader about who is allowed to log in and what
# devices they own.
#
# When a computer tries to log in, it perform a cryptographic challenge that
# proves it owns this key - but that requires the *private* key, whereas this is
# the *public* key. That's why it's secure to publish these!
