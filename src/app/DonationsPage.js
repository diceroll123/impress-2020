        <p>
          Dress to Impress has been around a long timeâ€”from back when Matchu was
          in middle school! Without a real source of income, we used to depend a
          lot on community donations to keep the site running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, life has changed a lot, and we're able to comfortably fund
          Dress to Impress out-of-pocket. But we're still very grateful to the
          donors who got us through those tougher years! Here's a showcase of
          their outfits ðŸ’–
        </p>

          {/* Thanking Fastly somewhere in a sponsors page on our site is a
           * condition of the program, so here we are! But also it's a great
           * deal and I mean what I say! */}
          We're also grateful to <FastlyLogoLink />, who offer us some CDN
          hosting services under their non-profit &amp; open-source partner
          program! They help us load all the big images around the site much
          faster! Thank you!
