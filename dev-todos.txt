* Use accessible click targets for item lists! Honestly, can they be checkboxes?
* Use react-virtualized instead of our own scroller, but we need total count known, and we need another solution for the CSS transitions in the outfit case
* Restore good download behavior: use crossOrigin for everything, and remove cache-buster in the URL we use for canvas
